# Smartyparse

Smartyparse is an intelligent general-purpose binary parsing, marshalling, serializing, etc library. Capable of dynamic operations, self-describing formats, nested formats, etc. Use it to encode, decode, and develop binary formats quickly and easily.

Smartyparse is under development as part of the Ethyr encrypted email-like messaging application. **If you would like to support either Smartyparse or Ethyr, please consider contributing to our [IndieGoGo campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ethyr-modern-encrypted-email).**
